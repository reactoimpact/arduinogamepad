# arduino gamepad
#### Create a functional gamepad with just a Aurdino uno and python!

This respoisiory holds all the code required for the Instructable. 
If you find an issue with the code, or want a new feture, leave an issue describing the problem.

If anyone knows how to bundle the python file into an .exe it would be greatly apreciated. (I have tried but it shows an error)
